### Hi, I'm Taylor
<p>
I am a Computer Science student at the University of Kentucky. When I am not grinding on leetcode I am drawing or working on my Portfolio-Site. <br>
Hit me up if you need any front-end design done for a project, I love helping out anyway that I can! <br>
I am currently on the hunt for a New-Grad position for when I graduate in May 2024. <br>
</p>
